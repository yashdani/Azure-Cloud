Description: IBM Cloud Object Storage - Python SDK
        =====================================
        
        This package allows Python developers to write software that interacts
        with `IBM Cloud Object
        Storage <https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/about-cos.html>`__.
        It is a fork of the `boto3 library <https://github.com/boto/boto3>`__ 
        and can stand as a drop-in replacement if the application needs to connect to object storage using
        an S3-like API and does not make use of other AWS services.
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        -  `Core documentation for IBM
           COS <https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/getting-started.html>`__
        -  `Python API reference
           documentation <https://ibm.github.io/ibm-cos-sdk-python>`__

        -  `Building from source <#building-from-source>`__
        -  `Getting help <#getting-help>`__
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        You'll need: \* An instance of COS. \* An API key from `IBM Cloud
        Identity and Access
        Management <https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam/users_roles.html>`__ with at
        least ``Writer`` permissions. \* The ID of the instance of COS that you
        are working with. \* Token acquisition endpoint \* Service endpoint
        
        These values can be found in the IBM Cloud Console by `generating a
        'service
        credential' <https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/iam/service-credentials.html>`__.
        
        Using Python
        ------------
        
        Use of the Python SDK and example code can be found
        `here <https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/libraries/python.html#using-python>`__.
        
        Using a Service Credential
        --------------------------
        
        You can source credentials directly from a `Service
        Credential <https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/iam/service-credentials.html>`__
        JSON document generated in the IBM Cloud console saved to
        ``~/.bluemix/cos_credentials``. The SDK will automatically load these
        providing you have not explicitly set other credentials during client
        creation. If the Service Credential contain `HMAC
        keys <https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/hmac/credentials.html>`__
        the client will use those and authenticate using a signature, otherwise
        the client will use the provided API key to authenticate using bearer
        tokens.
        
        Aspera high-speed transfer
        --------------------------
        
        It is now possible to use the IBM Aspera high-speed transfer service as
        an alternative method to managed transfers of larger objects. The Aspera
        high-speed transfer service is especially effective across long
        distances or in environments with high rates of packet loss. For more
        details, check out the `IBM Cloud
        documentation <https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/basics/aspera.html#using-libraries-and-sdks>`__.
        
        Archive Tier Support
        --------------------
        
        You can automatically archive objects after a specified length of time
        or after a specified date. Once archived, a temporary copy of an object
        can be restored for access as needed. Restore time may take up to 15
        hours.
        
        An archive policy is set at the bucket level by calling the
        ``put_bucket_lifecycle_configuration`` method on a client instance. A
        newly added or modified archive policy applies to new objects uploaded
        and does not affect existing objects. For more detail, `see the
        documentation <https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/libraries/python.html#python>`__.
        
        Immutable Object Storage
        ------------------------
        
        Users can configure buckets with an Immutable Object Storage policy to
        prevent objects from being modified or deleted for a defined period of
        time. The retention period can be specified on a per-object basis, or
        objects can inherit a default retention period set on the bucket. It is
        also possible to set open-ended and permanent retention periods.
        Immutable Object Storage meets the rules set forth by the SEC governing
        record retention, and IBM Cloud administrators are unable to bypass
        these restrictions. For more detail, `see the IBM Cloud
        documentation <https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/libraries/python.html#python>`__.
        
        Note: Immutable Object Storage does not support Aspera transfers via the
        SDK to upload objects or directories at this stage.
        
        Building from source
        --------------------
        
        Assuming that you have Python and ``virtualenv`` installed, set up your
        environment and install the required dependencies like this instead of
        the ``pip install ibm-cos-sdk`` defined above:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/ibm/ibm-cos-sdk-python.git
            $ cd ibm-cos-sdk-python
            $ virtualenv venv
            ...
            $ . venv/bin/activate
            $ pip install -r requirements.txt
            $ pip install -e .
